# PyBubble

A very very bare bones attempt at a python clone of good old Puzzble Bobble game.

## History

These are my notes from pygame back in 2005. Not sure how accurate or how much sense they make today:

> Well, there's still much to be done. New lines coming down after 15 seconds, game end and of course, the most important part, multiplayer feature. I hope to get enough time to carry on with this. The framerate is coming down as new features are added and that's a problem. I didn't want any early optimizations. And I don't think this is an early pessimization. But the way the framerate is decreasing is worrying. Have fun!!
